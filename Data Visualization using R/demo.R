# R can be used as a calculator
# It can be directly implemented on the console or on a R script for complex operations
# Demo for mathematical functions such as +,-,*,/,^, prompt symbol (>)
# : is used to specify a range, both limits included
# There are built-in constants such as pi => (1:5)+pi
# We can extract integer and remainder of modular arithmetic- %% for remainder and %/% for integer part
# The workspace is known as the global environment that can be used to store the results of calculations,
# and other objects (variables).

# interest <- 10.45^2 (we can also use =, but <- is preferred as we are requesting an action rather than 
# stating a relation)
# Keep in mind that R is case sensitive.
x <- 1:10 # is different from X
# R provides us with built-in functions such as mean()
MEAN <- mean
MEAN(x) 
# We have created a user-defined function which calls the built-in function

# List all the objects in the workspace using objects() or ls() function
ls()
objects()

# Remember that if we quit our R session without saving the workspace, then these objects will disappear. 
# If we save the workspace, then the workspace will be restored at our next R session.
