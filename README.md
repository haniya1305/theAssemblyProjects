# TheAssemblyProjects

**Summer Internship 2022**

*May- August 2022*

During my summer internship, I worked for a non-profit organization called The Assembly, under in5 Technologies. 

Due course of this internship I was able to discover and work on various aspects of technologies such as different python libraries such as Pygame, BeautifulSoup and Django, softwares such as Spline and Processing to develop applications and games, and tools such as R and Wireshark for data analysis.

I was given the wonderful opportunity to work with the other interns to brainstorm and research on topics that interested us. We also conducted workshops and has guest speakers support us for the same as well.
